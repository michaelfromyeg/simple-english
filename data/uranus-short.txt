<p><a class="key">Uranus</a> is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a <a class="key">gas giant</a> with a blue-green color. Most of Uranus is made of water, ammonia, and methane, which astronomers call "ice" or volatiles.</p>

<p>Uranus has some unique characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is very cold, reaching temperatures of -224°C (-371°F).</li>
  <li>Uranus has a tilt of 82.23°, causing extreme seasons.</li>
  <li>Its days last 17 hours and 14 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Uranus is the third-largest planet in diameter and the fourth-largest in mass. It has a rocky core, a thick mantle of "ice," and an outer atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The planet also has unexplained climate phenomena like high wind speeds of 900 km/h (560 mph).</p>

<p>Like other giant planets, Uranus has rings, a magnetosphere, and many <a class="key">moons</a>. There are 13 main rings and 28 moons, with the five largest being Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.</p>

<p>Uranus is visible to the naked eye but was not identified as a planet until 1781 by <a class="key">William Herschel</a>. The planet was named after the Greek god Uranus, grandfather of Zeus. As of 2024, Uranus has only been visited once by a spacecraft, Voyager 2, in 1986. There are plans for future missions to study Uranus further.</p>
