    <title>Edmonton - Capital of Alberta, Canada</title>

    <p>
        /ˈɛdməntən/ ⓘ ED-mən-tən is the capital city of the Canadian province of
        Alberta. Edmonton is situated on the North Saskatchewan River and is the
        centre of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region, which is surrounded by
        Alberta's central region. The city anchors the northern end of what
        Statistics Canada defines as the "Calgary–Edmonton Corridor", a region
        spanning between Edmonton and the city of Calgary, Alberta's largest
        city, which includes the many smaller municipalities between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
        As of 2021, Edmonton had a city population of 1,010,899 and a
        metropolitan population of 1,418,118, making it the fifth-largest city
        and sixth-largest metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. Edmonton is both
        the northernmost city and metropolitan area in North America to have a
        population of over one million. A resident of Edmonton is known as an
        Edmontonian.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Early Inhabitants</h3>
    <p>
        Edmonton was first inhabited by First Nations peoples of Algonquian,
        Athabaskan, and Siouan origin. These peoples and their ancestors
        inhabited the area of the modern city intermittently beginning at the
        close of the last glacial period, perhaps as early as 12,000 BC. The
        city was also a historic site for the Métis, who held many narrow lots
        along the North Saskatchewan which gave access to resources in the area.
        By 1882, these lots numbered about 44, after which they were displaced
        and integrated into the expanding city of Edmonton.
    </p>
    <h3>Early European Exploration and Trade</h3>
    <p>
        Anthony Henday may have been the first European to enter the area of
        modern-day Edmonton while exploring the prairies of Rupert's Land for
        the Hudson's Bay Company in the autumn of 1754. By 1795, many trading
        posts had been established around the present metropolitan area, and by
        1801 they had all moved to the current site of the city of Edmonton.
        "Fort Edmonton", as it was known, became the main centre for trade in
        the area after the 1821 merger of the HBC and the NWC.
    </p>
    <h3>Development into a City</h3>
    <p>
        Edmonton remained sparsely populated until the Canadian acquisition of
        Rupert's Land in 1870, followed eventually by the arrival of the
        Canadian Pacific Railway in 1891, its inauguration as a city in 1904,
        and its designation as the capital of the new province of Alberta in
        1906. Edmonton's growth as a city has been facilitated through the
        absorption of five adjacent urban municipalities (Strathcona, North
        Edmonton, West Edmonton, Beverly and Jasper Place) in addition to a
        series of annexations through 1982, and the annexation of 8,260 ha (82.6
        km2; 31.9 sq mi) of land from Leduc County and the City of Beaumont on
        January 1, 2019.
    </p>
    <h3>Modern Edmonton</h3>
    <p>
        Known as the "Gateway to the North", the city is now a staging point for
        large-scale oil sands projects occurring in northern Alberta and
        large-scale diamond mining operations in the Northwest Territories.
        Edmonton is a cultural, governmental and educational centre. It hosts
        festivals year-round, reflected in the nickname "Canada's Festival
        City". It is home to Canada's largest mall, West Edmonton Mall (the
        world's largest mall from 1981 until 2004); and Fort Edmonton Park,
        Canada's largest living history museum.
    </p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        Established as the first permanent settlement in the area of what is now
        Edmonton, the Hudson's Bay Company trading post of Fort Edmonton (also
        known as Edmonton House) was named after Edmonton, Middlesex, England.
        The fort's name was chosen by William Tomison, who was in charge of its
        construction, taking the fort's namesake from the hometown of the Lake
        family – at least five of whom were influential members of the Hudson's
        Bay Company between 1696 and 1807. In turn, the name of Edmonton derives
        from Adelmetone, meaning 'farmstead/estate of Ēadhelm' (from Ēadhelm, an
        Old English personal name, and tūn); this earlier form of the name
        appears in the Domesday Book of 1086.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indigenous languages refer to the Edmonton area by multiple names which
        reference the presence of fur trading posts. In Cree, the area is known
        as ᐊᒥᐢᑿᒌᐚᐢᑲᐦᐃᑲᐣ amiskwacîwâskahikan, which translates to "Beaver Hills
        House" and references the location's proximity to the Beaver Hills east
        of Edmonton. In Blackfoot, the area is known as Omahkoyis; in Nakota
        Sioux, the area is known as Titâga; in Tsuutʼina, the area is known as
        Nââsʔágháàchú. The Blackfoot name translates to 'big lodge', while the
        Nakota Sioux and Tsuutʼina names translate to 'big house'. In
        Denesuline, the area is known as Kuę́ Nedhé, a metonymic toponym which
        also generally means 'city'.
