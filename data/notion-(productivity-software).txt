Users can sign into Notion using their Google account, Apple ID or email.
Features[edit]
Notion does not require specialized training to use. It uses AI and a library of free and fee-based templates, with the Notion AI functionality, users can write and improve content, summarize existing notes, daily standup, adjust the tone, translate or check text.[29][30] Security features include Security Assertion Markup Language single sign-on and private team spaces for their Business and Enterprise tiers.[29]
Notion enables its users to integrate with more than 70 other SaaS tools, such as Slack, GitHub, GitLab, Zoom, Jira, Cisco Webex, Zapier, and Typeform.[31]
Blocks[edit]
Notion is made up of blocks (These blocks are similar to elements in HTML). This allows users to customize a page by adding and moving blocks in various ways. In June 2021, Notion released a synced block, which is a type that, when copied and pasted across different pages in a user's workspace, shows edits between them.[32]
Databases[edit]
One of Notion's features is its database. Databases are used for storing information and can hold any number of rows and columns. By default, each row will have two pre-populated properties: 'Name' and 'Tags'. Users can add more properties, such as date, checkbox, multi-select, URL, and more. When creating databases, users can choose to either create it 'inline', within an already existing page, or as its own page.[33]
Templates[edit]
Notion users can make and use templates. Notion hosts its own template gallery, where users can browse through templates made by other Notion creators. However, not all of these templates are free to use. Some creators profit from selling Notion templates. Jason Ruiyi Chen, from Singapore, made $239,000 by selling his Notion templates to his Twitter audience. Thomas Frank, a YouTuber with 2.8 million subscribers as of February 2023, made $1 million in 2022.[34][35]
Notion AI[edit]
Notion AI uses artificial intelligence, which enables prediction of some results, text generation and solving arithmetic. It will also work with other datasets in response to an input by the user of the AI. This AI can automate some tasks and assist the user to make a paragraph or outline from a line of text. Notion AI has its own subscription set which is $10 per month per person.[36][37] The service is powered by the API of Anthropic.[38]

Notion Calendar integrates time management with the workspaces and databases within Notion. It allows you to see and manage your professional and personal events in one application, syncing with Google Calendar for consolidated scheduling. With Notion Calendar, you can link database entries to calendar events, enabling efficient planning and task tracking. To get started, users download the app, connect their calendar accounts, and can then integrate their Notion workspaces and databases for a unified view of tasks and schedules.[39]
