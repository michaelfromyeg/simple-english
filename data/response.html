The winner is awarded the Stanley Cup, North America's oldest professional sports trophy and one of the \"most important championships available to the sport [of ice hockey]\" according to the International Ice Hockey Federation.</p>\n        <p>Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was donated in 1892 by Lord Stanley of Preston, then\u2013Governor General of Canada, initially as a \"challenge trophy\" for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. ...</p>\n    </section>\n    <section>\n        <h2>History</h2>\n        <p>The Stanley Cup was first awarded to the Montreal Hockey Club in 1893 when the team won the 1893 AHAC season. The team then had to defend its champion-title both through league championships and challenge games organised by the Stanley Cup trustees. Until 1912, these challenges could take place before or during a league season. After 1912, the trustees ordered that challenges only take place after all league games were completed.</p>\n        <table>\n            <caption>Victoria vs. Toronto</caption>\n            <thead>\n                <tr>\n                    <th>Date</th>\n                    <th>Winning team</th>\n                    <th>Score</th>\n                    <th>Losing team</th>\n                    <th>Rules</th>\n                    <th>Notes</th>\n                </tr>\n            </thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>March 14, 1914</td>\n                    <td>Toronto HC</td>\n                    <td>5\u20132</td>\n                    <td>Victoria Aristocrats</td>\n                    <td>NHA</td>\n                    <td></td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>March 17, 1914</td>\n                    <td>Toronto HC</td>\n                    <td>6\u20135</td>\n                    <td>Victoria Aristocrats</td>\n                    <td>PCHA</td>\n                    <td>15:00, OT</td>\n                </tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td>March 19, 1914</td>\n                    <td>Toronto HC</td>\n                    <td>2\u20131</td>\n                    <td>Victoria Aristocrats</td>\n                    <td>NHA</td>\n                    <td>Toronto Hockey Club wins best-of-five series 3 games to 0</td>\n                </tr>\n            </tbody>\n        </table>\n        <p>...</p>\n    </section>\n    <section>\n        <h2>Broadcasting</h2>\n        <p>The first television broadcast of the Stanley Cup Finals in Canada was in 1953.
