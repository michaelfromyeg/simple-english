        <p>Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was donated in 1892 by Lord Stanley of Preston, then\u2013Governor General of Canada, initially as a \"challenge trophy\" for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. ...</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Stanley Cup was first awarded to the Montreal Hockey Club in 1893 when the team won the 1893 AHAC season. The team then had to defend its champion-title both through league championships and challenge games organised by the Stanley Cup trustees. Until 1912, these challenges could take place before or during a league season. After 1912, the trustees ordered that challenges only take place after all league games were completed.</p>
